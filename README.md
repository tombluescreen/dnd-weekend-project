# dnd-project-main

This was a coding challenge I made in a weekend.

It is a API for managing dungeons and dragons characters and there environment. I tried to stay as OOP as possible with this project.

Posted for archive.

### Final Progress Report
- A solid attribute and character system
- Understandable API 
- Code accounts for "By Ref" and "By Value" python weirdness

#### What I wish I did
- GUI/Web client
- Performance could be improved
- Their are a lot more DND edge cases than I originally realized which really bogged down development
